# Adding Wine Versions

Wine is open-source software that lets you use Windows software on Linux (or Mac via Crossover), by translating Windows code to Linux readable code.\
Because it’s open-source software, there’s many different spins on Wine, which are called wine flavours. Within each wine flavour, there are different versions.\
In practice, this is like Wine Version 1.2, or Proton Version 7.2, and so on.\
In the Linux world, everyone wants to make different wine flavours depending on what they need for their software.\
Generally, we have these 3 wine flavours:

* Vanilla Wine, the original source code, which can be found at [winehq](https://wiki.winehq.org/Download)
* Proton Wine, often referred to as just “Proton”, this is Valve’s take or branch on Vanilla Wine, made specifically for games
* Proton GE, due to legal issues with getting Windows files (because Valve is a corporation), Proton GE was made by a community member named GloriousEggroll which uses these Windows files

As a result, this wine flavour is often the most used for games. With Visual Novels, we’ll be mainly dealing with the Proton GE, and Lutris Wine wine flavours.

## Getting wine versions & flavours

Generally, the easiest way to get (our) wine flavours & versions is to use ProtonUP-QT.
We recommend using the ProtonUP-QT flatpak because it’s platform agnostic.
To get this, visit this [link](https://flathub.org/apps/details/net.davidotek.pupgui2)

Once you’ve downloaded it, open it up. The menus are simple.

1. Select the right program, then click Add version
2. You’ll be greeted with an option to choose a Wine flavour and Wine version.

Choose the one you need and hit Install. That’s it!\
You can also use this for Steam games as well
