# Subarashiki Hibi ~Furenzoku Sonzai~
## Steam patch installation

> [!info] Information
> By default, the Steam version has only the first chapter only playable. The patch unlocks the rest of the game as it is age restricted.

> [!warning] Warning
> Get the patch from [JAST USA](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/jastpatches/frontwing/Wonderfuleveryday_18patch_ver2.0.zip) and the [voice mod](https://mega.nz/file/gFAiXQ6B#mBd2V-2N7RQUFMM2AE_8vL84tO1clh-pHaFayAfeVak).

To install, drag and drop the JAST USA 18+ patch files inside of the Steam game folder then the voice mod files (in that order). To find it, open Steam, right click on "Wonderful Everyday Down the Rabbit Hole", "Properties", "Local Files", then Browse. This opens up the game folder.
