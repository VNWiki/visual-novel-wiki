# Root Double -Before Crime * After Days
## Known issue

### Linux / Steam Deck

Pixelated fonts. Checked with "Lutris FSHack 7.2" and Windows 10 fonts imported. The game appears to have its own font given that there is a font48_eng.xtx file though. Enabling font smoothing with winetricks doesn’t do anything.
