# Bakappuru Supplement
## Installation

### Linux

> [!info] Information
> This game uses EntisGLS, which is a rather mature engine which can correctly handle non-japanese environments. However the installer can't.
> The packaged (DVD) version requires you to *insert* the disc on first startup of the game. Virtual discs are also supported.
> Tested with [wine-10.20](/linux/adding-wine-versions). Later versions should work.


#### Steps

1. Prepare the game files. You can mount the ripped ISO file or just insert it into your disc drive if available.
