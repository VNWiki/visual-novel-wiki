2. Next, click on "Run EXE inside Wine prefix" and select the installer executable named "EROGE.part1.exe".
3. Set the directory where you want the game to be installed.
4. Make sure you have "EROGE.part2.rar" in the same directory as the executable.
5. The installer will close itself when finished.
6. Edit the configuration of the game:

   * In "Game options", select "eroge.exe" for "Executable"
  
7. Run the game for the first time and, you should get the Team Anise screen if everything works.

2. Edit the configuration of the game:

   * In "System options", check "Enable gamescope", set "Gamescope output resolution" to your native resolution or to a 4:3 one and "Gamescope game resolution" to "800x600"

#### Checksum error

If you see a checksum error when installing the game, download the installer files once again.

## Steam Deck

Same as Linux except you don't need `gamescope` (SteamOS includes it by default).
