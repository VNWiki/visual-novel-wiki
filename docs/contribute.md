## Test games

If a visual novel isn't on the Wiki yet, you can try to run it with Wine. If a game is already there, check if the instructions are up-to-date (the ones mentionning Lutris runner 7.21 or Wine 7 are considered outdated). Finally, you can check if reports made by other people work on your side.

### Tips

* Most visual novels should work fine with Proton-GE 9 and up
* Run games with Wine 10 WoW64 builds
* Use Wine 9 WoW64 builds and older non-WoW64 builds if newer versions don't work
* Try already tested games with Wine 10 WoW64 builds and then with Proton-GE
* Try non-staging and staging WoW64 builds as some games can give different results

## Write reports

Once the game has been tested, you can write an article on the Wiki or write a report on Wine AppDB/ProtonDB (even if the game doesn't work properly). Keep in mind that Wine AppDB is focused on vanilla Wine. When making a report, follow [their rules](https://gitlab.winehq.org/winehq/appdb/-/wikis/Test-Results-Guidelines) and only mention the custom Wine version (Lutris/Bottles runner, Proton) you used as a workaround in the ["Extra Comments" field](https://gitlab.winehq.org/winehq/appdb/-/wikis/Test-Results-Guidelines#select-the-correct-wine-version) of your report.

## Write protonfixes

If you have some programming knowledge, you can contribute to the [umu-protonfixes project](https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-protonfixes).

## Improve the Wiki

You can also help by editing the existing Wiki pages.

### Tasks

* Migrate Bottles compatibility list to the main one
