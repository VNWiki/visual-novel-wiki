Within each wine flavour, there are different versions.<br> In practice, this is like Wine Version 1.2, or Proton Version 7.2, and so on.<br> In the Linux world, everyone wants to make different wine flavours depending on what they need for their software.<br> Generally, we have these 3 wine flavours:</p><ul><li>Vanilla Wine, the original source code, which can be found at <a href="https://wiki.winehq.org/Download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">winehq</a></li><li>Proton Wine, often referred to as just “Proton”, this is Valve’s take or branch on Vanilla Wine, made specifically for games</li><li>Proton GE, due to legal issues with getting Windows files (because Valve is a corporation), Proton GE was made by a community member named GloriousEggroll which uses these Windows files</li></ul><p>As a result, this wine flavour is often the most used for games.
